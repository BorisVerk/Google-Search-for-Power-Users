## installing ##

- `git clone https://github.com/BorisVerk/Google-Search-for-Power-Users`
- Go to chrome extensions
- Enable `Developer Mode`
- Click `Load Unpacked Extension`
- Select the base folder of the extension (should be `Google-Search-for-Power-Users/`)

## todo ##

auto click the first result, unless you got to the query page by pressing the back button.

## custom "search engines" ##

An underrated feature. Go to Settings -> Manage Search Engines, and then add
- Search engine: Reddit
- Keyword: r
- URL with %s in place of query: https://www.google.ca/search?q=site%3Areddit.com+%s
now when you type `r cats` into the chrome omnibar, it's a much better reddit search.

## recommended google extensions ##
