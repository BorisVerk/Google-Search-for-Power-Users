# Google Search for Power Users #

Strip away everything from Google Search except the search bar and results.

Use `j/k` to navigate links, and `/` to google. `n` to go to the next page of results

## note ##

If you use [Personal Blocklist](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nolijncfnkgaikbjbdaogikpmpbdcdef), and you want to block a domain, you will have to disable this extension in __Extensions --> Google Search for Power Users --> Enabled__ (uncheck the box).

- Sometimes the footer will not be pushed all the way to the bottom when the window is maximized. To make debugging even funner, it gets pushed whenever I open the dev console.
- Will add options to not hide certain elements (blocklist buttons and G+ notifications)

I probably missed a few links that should not be highlighted when you press Tab. Open an issue if you find something I missed, make sure to include the search query.
